## Email Management

### Why Email Management is Important
Email is crucial for professional communication. Checking it frequently is essential for timely responses and effective communication. Proper email management enhances productivity, prevents missing important messages, and maintains a professional image.

### Set Up Your Email

#### Choose an Email Client

- **Desktop Clients**: Examples include [Microsoft Outlook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook), [Apple Mail](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mail/id1108187098), and [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/). For DPI, **we recommend using Outlook**.

- **Web Clients**: Common examples include [outlook.office.com](outlook.office.com), [mail.google.com](mail.google.com) and [mail.yahoo.com](mail.yahoo.com). This is dependent on whichever email service you are using.
- **Mobile Clients**: Most smartphones come with built-in email apps. You can also download third-party apps like [Gmail](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480), [Outlook](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596), or [Spark](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-mail-ai-email-inbox/id997102246).


#### Add Your Email Account
- Navigate to the account setup section (usually found in settings or preferences).
- Enter your email address and password.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

#### Configure Notifications
- Ensure notifications are enabled for new emails.
  - For Outlook on MacOS, you may need to allow notifications: go to `System Settings` > `Notifications` > `Microsoft Outlook` and toggle `Allow notifications`.
- Customize notification settings to avoid unnecessary distractions (e.g., only notify for important emails).

#### Organize Your Inbox
- Use folders or labels to categorize emails.
- Set up filters or rules to automatically sort incoming mail.
- Archive or delete emails you no longer need to keep your inbox tidy.

#### Check Your Email Frequently
- Set specific times during the day to check and respond to emails.
- Enable push notifications on your phone for immediate alerts.

#### Out of Office Automatic Replies
- Set up automatic replies when you are away from work. In the toolbar, navigate to `Tools` > `Automatic Replies...`.

- Choose `Send automatic replies`, write your automatic message and set the start and end times. Make sure your message includes a greeting, the date you will be out of office, and the person to contact instead.

- If you work with people outside of your organization, make sure to tick the box for `Send replies outside my organization`. You will need to copy/paste your automatic message.

## Writing Effective Emails

### Sending an Email
- In Outlook, click on `New Message` to compose a new message.
![](assets/new-message-create.png)
- Fill in the recipient's email address in the `To` field. You can fill in the `Cc` (carbon copy) field for people who need to be informed but are not the primary recipient, and the `Bcc` (blind carbon copy) field for recipients who should receive the email but remain hidden from others. `Bcc` is also useful for sending mass emails without revealing recipients' email addresses.
![](assets/new-message-body.png)
- Write a descriptive subject line that summarizes the email's content. Write a clear and concise message in the body of the email. Remember to sign off with a professional closing.
- If you have any attachment, click on the paperclip icon to attach files.
